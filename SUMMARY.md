# Summary of Changes

We've implemented full AO process integration for your mines game. The randomness generation is now handled by a decentralized AO process on Arweave. Here's what we've done:

1. Updated the randomness integration code to use the AO process
2. Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. Updated the game flow to correctly use the AO process IDs
4. Added detailed logs for debugging and verification
5. Created a comprehensive guide for deployment

You should now meet the selection criteria for the Arweave Hacker House by properly integrating with an AO process.
